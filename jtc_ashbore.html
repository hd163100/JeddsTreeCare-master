<h1>Ash-bore</h1>
<p>The Emerald Ash Borer, commonly referred to as the EAB beetle is a bright metallic green beetle which is 10-13 millimeters.  The EAB beetle has caused millions of ash trees in North America to die, since it’s accidental introduction from Asia.  Here are five facts to help you understand this pest and the economic destruction it has caused.</p>
<h2>Information about the Ash-Bore</h2>
<p>The emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis, is an exotic insect pest from Asia. The flattened, creamy white larval stage feeds below the bark and cuts off the living, water and nutrient conducting vessels causing tree death. Adults are small elongated oval beetles that are metallic green in color</p>
<h2>Facts</h2>
<p>With the help of dendrochronological reconstruction (a method of scientific dating based on the analysis of tree rings), scientists have traced EAB destruction back to the early 1990’s in Michigan.</p>
<p>An EAB beetle’s lifespan ranges from 1-2 years in North America.</p>
<p> The EAB beetle kills ash trees by destroying the water and nutrient conducting tissues under the tree’s bark.  A tree will die within two years of signs of the EAB beetle.</p>
<p>The Emerald Ash Borer is spread through the moving of firewood from it’s initial location.  We also know that the EAB beetle can fly a half of a mile from the tree where they have emerged.  For more information on moving firewood</p>
<p>The Emerald Ash Borer is now recognized as the most harmful pest in North America.  Having caused the destruction of over a million ash trees, this beetle has been recognized as a serious problem which can cost billions of dollars to fix.</p>
